- A simple and elegant Pomodoro Timer built using Python’s Tkinter GUI library.
- This app helps you improve focus and productivity by following the Pomodoro Technique — 25 minutes of work followed by short and long breaks.

How it works?
1. Click Start → begins a 25-minute work timer.
2. After each session, a 5-minute short break starts automatically.
3. Every 4 work sessions → a 20-minute long break.
4. Click Reset anytime to start fresh.
